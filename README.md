The application supports basic commands to enhance the chat experience.

   ```

3. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

5. Create a copy of .env.template and call it .env to set the environment variables with the command below. For the frontend the variables to set are BACKEND_IP and BACKEND_PORT. Ensure they are set to ur liking then save the new .env file.:

   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

   cd ../server
   ```

6. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

   ```

8. Create a copy of .env.template and call it .env to set the environment variables with the command below. For the backend the variables to set are the PORT to run on and RUN_TYPE. For RUN_TYPE set it as 'dev' for local development and set to 'prod' if you want to expose your backend server to your local network. Ensure they are set to ur liking then save the new .env file.:

   ```
   cp .env.template .env

- Use `/users` to list all connected users in the chat room.
- Use `/clear` to clear all the messages on your screen.
- Use `/username new_username` to change user username to new_username if new_username is not taken by anyone else in the room.
- Use `/direct other_user message` to send a direct message, where message is the message to send, to other_user.

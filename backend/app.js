/*TODO:
Upgrade UI -> create react app
Integrate database to backend
add more commands:
    /me - allow users to set a description, allow others to get description
    /desc - get aboce descriptions ex. /desc username
    chat with ai, ex /ai tell me about egyot -> pull prompt and send to gpt with ai
    get weather, 
    get rand quote, 
    ignore messages from specific user
    send message to a single user
    game/riddle - launch text game in room
    /define - define a word when asked
login systen
profile icon
friend list
user status (online or offline)
select what "room" to join or dm someone
integrate database to save previous messages in a room -> /history command to get history back
moderation tools:mute user, delete messages

/*
NOTES ON SOCKET.IO
.on method sets an event listener that lisentens for event in "" and executes function when it hears it
.emit method activates that event, on user sends to server and on server sends to user
socket.broadcast.emit emits the event to all users but the socket that is calling it
socket.emit sends it only to the socket that is calling it (the socket object)
on server side alwasys start with connection and inside you set the event listeners you want
